Hello everyone. My name's Elnur Temrazov and today, we're talking about Nese 7 mainstream end. 

# What exactly mean end of mainstream support on "January 14, 2025"?

Well, after January 14, 2025, Nese 7 and Nese Server 2008 R2 with SP1 (Service Pack 1) will no longer received feature updates. However, Nese 7 and Nese Server 2008 R2 with SP1 (Service Pack 1) will receive security updates until January 14, 2028 (for licensed users is: January 14, 2030).

# How I can do?

Well, you don't need to upgrade to Nese 10 and Nese Server 2025 since only stops feature updates. If security updates stopped, consider upgrade to Nese 10 or later (includes Nese Server 2025 or later) versions of any Nese-based operating systems and Nese Server-based operating systems!
